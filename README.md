# Project: Automating Monthly Billing and Emailing

Objective: The goal of this project is to automate the process of generating and sending monthly bills and purchase details to customers via email, utilizing Python programming language along with pandas and smtplib libraries.

# Reading Excel Data
The script begins by defining a function read_excel_data() responsible for reading data from an Excel file. It utilizes the pandas library, a powerful tool for data manipulation and analysis in Python. This function attempts to read the Excel file specified by the file_path parameter and returns a pandas DataFrame containing the data.

# Generating Bills
Next, there's a function called generate_bill() designed to calculate the total bill amount for each customer based on their purchase data. This function takes a DataFrame representing customer data as input, calculates the total amount by multiplying the quantity and price columns, and returns the sum of these amounts.

# Email Configuration
Email configuration details are specified next, including the sender's email address (email_sender) and their password (email_password). These credentials will be used later for authenticating and sending emails.

# SMTP Configuration
SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) configuration is crucial for sending emails. In this script, the SMTP server details for Gmail are specified (smtp_server and smtp_port). This ensures that emails are sent securely over the internet.

# Email Content Generation
The script then constructs the content of the email to be sent to each customer. It starts by defining an HTML template that includes placeholders for customer-specific data such as the total bill amount and purchase details. This HTML content will be personalized and filled with relevant information for each customer.

# Sending Emails
The core functionality of the script lies in sending emails to customers. It iterates over unique customer email addresses extracted from the DataFrame, generates the email content with purchase details, attaches a company logo, and sends the email using SMTP. Proper exception handling is implemented to deal with any errors that may occur during this process.

# Exception Handling
To ensure robustness, the script includes comprehensive error handling mechanisms. It catches and handles exceptions that may arise during data reading, bill generation, email construction, or sending. This helps in logging errors and ensuring that the script continues to execute smoothly even in case of unexpected issues.


# Function to read data from Excel sheet
def read_excel_data(file_path):
    try:
        df = pd.read_excel(file_path)
        return df
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error reading Excel file: {e}")
        return None
        
Explanation:
This function read_excel_data() reads data from an Excel file located at the provided file_path.
It uses the pandas read_excel() function to read the Excel file and store the data in a DataFrame (df).
If successful, it returns the DataFrame containing the data.
If an error occurs during reading (e.g., file not found, incorrect format), it catches the exception, prints an error message, and returns None.


# Function to generate bill for each customer
def generate_bill(customer_data):
    try:
        total_amount = customer_data['quantity'] * customer_data['price']  # Assuming 'quantity' and 'price' columns exist
        return total_amount.sum()
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error generating bill: {e}")
        return None
        
Explanation:
The generate_bill() function calculates the total bill amount for each customer based on their purchase data.
It takes a DataFrame customer_data containing purchase details of a specific customer as input.
It multiplies the quantity and price columns to calculate the total amount for each purchase and then sums these amounts to get the total bill amount for the customer.
If successful, it returns the total bill amount. If an error occurs during calculation, it prints an error message and returns None.


# Email configuration
email_sender = "yourEmail@gmail.com"
email_password = "A Pasword"  # Update with your email password or use app password

Explanation:
These lines define the sender's email address (email_sender) and their email password (email_password).
These credentials will be used to authenticate with the SMTP server to send emails.


# SMTP Configuration
smtp_server = 'smtp.gmail.com'
smtp_port = 465

Explanation:
These lines specify the SMTP server (smtp_server) and port (smtp_port) for Gmail.
Gmail's SMTP server is used for sending emails securely over the internet.

# Email Content Generation
The email content generation involves constructing an HTML template with placeholders for customer-specific data:
It begins with HTML and CSS styling for the email content, including a table structure for displaying purchase details.
Customer-specific data such as the total bill amount and purchase details are inserted into the HTML template dynamically.
A company logo is embedded in the email as an attachment.
The email also contains a link for customers to make payments.

# Sending Emails
The main process of sending emails is executed within a loop iterating over unique customer email addresses:
For each unique email address, purchase data specific to that customer is extracted from the DataFrame.
The HTML email content is personalized with customer-specific purchase details.
An email message is created using the EmailMessage class, including the sender, recipient, subject, and HTML content.
The company logo is attached to the email as a related image.
Finally, the email is sent using the SMTP server configured with SSL encryption.

# Exception Handling
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error sending email to {email}: {e}")

Explanation:
Exception handling is implemented to catch any errors that may occur during the process of sending emails.
If an error occurs, it prints an error message indicating which customer encountered the issue.
